### AI-Powered Job Application Automation Platform

**Mini Project – II**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**smartapply.ai** is an AI-powered job application automation platform designed to address inefficiencies, redundancy, and fragmentation in modern recruitment workflows. The platform treats a candidate’s professional identity as a structured, reusable, and evolving digital asset, enabling intelligent resume management, job relevance analysis, and controlled application automation.

The system aims to reduce repetitive manual effort for job seekers while improving alignment with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and enhancing transparency and user control over AI-assisted processes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today’s recruitment ecosystem, candidates are required to repeatedly enter the same career information across multiple job portals, often in inconsistent formats. This leads to:
- Application fatigue  
- Data inconsistency and fragmentation  
- Poor ATS compatibility  
- Missed opportunities for qualified candidates  

There is no unified system that manages professional identity as a centralized, reusable, and intelligent asset. **smartapply.ai** is designed to bridge this gap.
